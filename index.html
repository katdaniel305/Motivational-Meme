      <h1> When you realise what love is</h1>
      <p> Humility is a power but Love is the Superpower.</p>
      <p>When we genuinely love with a pure and undistorted mind we're connected to the Creator. The Creator is the source of everything. 
        The Supreme authoriy that governs every pure heart and that makes all the pure hearted act unusually and supernaturally.
      </p>
      <p>Love unusually intervenes before, during, and after we've ran out of all figures of option. It always against the odds and unaccustomed</p>
      <p> No wonder to enter into the upcoming Glorious Kingdom we need It's King in us, Who is no one else but Divine Love.</p>

      <h1>In the depths of Love [Phileo love]</h1>
      <p>Loving is caring but caring is very selective when it comes to human's nature.</p>
      <p>And I believe in selection there is election. Even God has His elected ones,what about me?</p>

      <h1>In the depths of Love [Phileo love]</h1>
      <h2>There's love in the air...</h2>
      <p>When two soulmates meet, the supernatural takes place and it's all about beauty.</p>
      <p>To those who admire it brings smile, good wishes and good inpirations. But to those who lack this superpower, it brings negative plans and hatred. 
        Let the haters do their work. They are as useful as the dogs are to the Shepher.They help to keep the Shepher's herd on track. Everything si working for my good...</p>

  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.
